# Drawing with the ```<canvas>``` element

1. Download and unzip the repository.
2. Inside this folder there are a number of files. Here are the ones we are interested in:

* *index.html*. This is the HTML file that is used in practical exercises. Notice the ```<canvas>``` element in this file.
* *exercises.js*. Open this in a text editor of your choice. This is where you will write your JavaScript. It already contains some code to get you started. It also contains the exercise questions (in comments, leave these questions commented out).
* Again, like in previous weeks, you will need to run the example on a web server.
